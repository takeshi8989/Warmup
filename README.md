# Warm Up üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüî•

Warm Up is a mobile app designed to transform your solo runs into motivating, competitive experiences. Whether you're running alone in a quiet park or through busy city streets, Warm Up brings the energy of running alongside others directly to your ears. The app simulates the sounds of footsteps around you, making it feel as if you're running with virtual companions who challenge you to push harder and go further.

## Features

### 1. Run with Virtual Companions
- **Footstep Sounds**: Hear the simulated sound of other runners' footsteps to give you the sensation of running with others, motivating you to keep up the pace.
- **Dynamic Audio Positioning**: The origin of the footsteps changes based on your running speed and location:
  - **If you slow down**, the footsteps move ahead of you, giving the impression that others are running faster.
  - **If you speed up**, the footsteps shift back, making it seem like you're pulling ahead.

### 2. Virtual Competitions
- **Join Worldwide Competitions**: Participate in running challenges and compete with people from anywhere in the world.
- **Distance Tracking**: Track the total distance you run during each session.
- **Virtual Map**: See the virtual locations of other runners on a map, allowing you to ‚Äúrun together‚Äù regardless of your physical location.

## How It Works

1. **Start a Run**: Begin a session and choose your preferred virtual companion settings.
2. **Audio Simulation**: As you run, footsteps are dynamically simulated to match your speed and movement.
3. **Adjust Pace**: The footsteps provide real-time feedback, encouraging you to run faster if they‚Äôre pulling ahead or helping you keep the lead.
4. **Join Competitions**: Participate in virtual races and track your distance and rank on a shared map.

## Why Use Warm Up?

Running alone can be less motivating and challenging than running with others. With Warm Up, you‚Äôll feel the thrill of having virtual competitors by your side, pushing you to achieve your personal best. Stay motivated, track your progress, and enjoy the fun and competitive spirit of running with others‚Äîno matter where you are!
